# Flutter BLoC and Clean Architecture Tutorial

I created this repository when I learnt `BLoC State Management` and `Clean Architecture` from this [**YouTube Playlist**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFyjjoCMAPtw1HIhSkgL92ONy5wEsermo&si=MjhLcViyEVgetyou).

Run the following command on you project terminal to install the required flutter packages:
```powershell
flutter pub add equatable bloc flutter_bloc
```
